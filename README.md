# Object_Detection for Car_Identification


## Objective of this notebook
- The purpose of this notebook is to perform descriptive statistics(Exploratory Data Analyses) and inferential statistics(Hypothesis Testing ) in python on the  given data set
- Details of the data set,attributes, context, domain and **summary of the code** are listed in the sections to follow.

## Data Description:
Data Set:

The data at hand contains medical costs of people characterized by certain
attributes. 

Attribute Information:
age: age of primary beneficiary
sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male
bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (kg / m ^2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9
children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents
smoker: Smoking
region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast,southwest, northwest.
charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance

## Domain:
Helathcare

## Summary of the Code:
- In this worksheet we perform Exploratory Data analyses/Descriptive tatistics  and Inferential Statistics(Hypothesis Testing) on a dataset 
- We begin by importing the data and doing some basic EDA/Descriptive stats  such as exploring the attributes ,checking for missing values/null values and  5 point summaries of attributes .
- We then go on to visualising the distributions of key attributes like age , bmi  and charges, checking their skewness, checking for outliers.
- We follow this up by doing  a bivariate analyses/pair plot on the attributes to check for correlation
- Finally we do hypothesis testing on certain claims on the data which would be important insights if proved true by statistical evidence.
